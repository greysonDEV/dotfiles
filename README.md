# Greyson's OSX dotfiles!

**Disclaimer:** Please do not hastily employ my dotfiles without understanding what each one entails and the settings they change. Use at your own risk!

### Flow
* [nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
  * Plugin Manager: [`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

### Installation
Before installing, it is recommended to make a backup of your existing dotfiles. Once your dotfiles are backed up, simply clone this repository and drag and drop files as needed. Alternatively, you can simply just do symbolic links:
```
ln <source file> <destination>
$ ln dotfiles/vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
