# Greyson's OSX dotfiles!

**Disclaimer:** Please do not hastily employ my dotfiles without understanding what each one entails and the settings they change. Use at your own risk!

### Contents
* vim (plugin manager: [`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug))
* tmux
* shell (`zsh`)
* bin (scripts)

### Installation
Before installing, it is recommended to make a backup of your existing dotfiles. Once your dotfiles are backed up, simply clone this repository and drag and drop files as needed. Alternatively, creating symbolic links are recommended:
```
ln <source file> <destination>
$ ln dotfiles/vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
