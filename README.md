# Greyson's OSX dotfiles!

These dotfiles cater to my wants and needs when developing or simply just using my device; feel free to take as needed!<br>
I develop on OSX with the popular *`vim`/`tmux`* combination in the `zsh` shell.

### Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/greysonDEV/dotfiles
```
